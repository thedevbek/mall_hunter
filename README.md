This is my first text based game in python. For class IT-140 at SNHU. It will be my first complete project. Will Green was my professor at SNHU. Class ending in June of 2022.

Things I have learned so far:
1. Variable names are very important and must be very descriptive for anyone who reads it and for yourself when you come back after a couple of months or years and you are like...What the hell does make_my_day function do? What is it for? ....Totally have learned that lesson.
2. As long as a while loop has the keyword while then the condition can be anything. For example while yes_or_no not in valid_responses: is a good while loop. If yes or no is not in the valid_responses it will print try again moron!
