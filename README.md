This is my first text based game in python. For class IT-140 at SNHU. It will be my first complete project. Will Green was my professor at SNHU. Class ending in June of 2022.

Things I have learned so far:
1. Variable names are very important and must be very descriptive for anyone who reads it and for yourself when you come back after a couple of months or years and you are like...What the hell does make_my_day function do? What is it for? ....Totally have learned that lesson.
2. As long as a while loop has the keyword while then the condition can be anything. For example while yes_or_no not in valid_responses: is a good while loop. If yes or no is not in the valid_responses it will print try again moron!

3. Standard data structure in computer science is the "associative array" which is also called a "map". In Python, this structure is called dictionary. This is the key:value pairs. An input mapped to an output. 

# for loop is going over every character in the beginning into statement and print it.
# sys standard for system. 
# sys.stdout.write prints to the screen. Unlike the print function it does not print a new line. It is also supposed to print the number of characters at the end.
# sys.stdout.flush() pushes out all the data that has been buffered to that point to a file object. While using stdout, data is stored in buffer memory (for some time or until the memory gets filled) before it gets written to terminal. Using flush() forces to empty the buffer and write to terminal even before buffer has empty space.
# I don't need # os.system('clear') after if statement is executed.
